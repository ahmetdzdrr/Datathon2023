## Introduction
This project aims to predict the target variable of "Öbek İsmi" in train dataset and make prediction at test dataset. We used Python and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn to analyze the data and build predictive models.


## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explored the distribution of all features with a histogram.
- Visualized the correlation between each feature1 and feature2 using a scatter plot.


## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variable
- Scaled numerical features

## Model Building
- Trained several machine learning models including Random Forest, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
